Part 1 - Proposal Submission

Name of Project: Datatera Metadata Functions

Proposal in one sentence: Datatera is a global marketplace to connect HealthData Providers with HealthTech companies by making larger samples of the high-quality real-world datasets available.

Description of the project and what problem is it solving: HealthTech AI companies are facing challenges to get access to qualitative medical datasets while they are building AI-models which results in bias and other errors and that takes a lot of time and money to maintain and manage. Datatera will provide a global data computing marketplace where Data Scientists will have the opportunity to train their AI models on high-qualitative and diverse training datasets while preserving privacy.

Grant Deliverables: (Target deliverables for the funding provided.)

Sensitive Data Inspector Function powered by AI <br />
Output a result of which columns could have sensitive data with ratio <br />
Qualitative Data Inspector Function powered by AI <br />
Output a result of how a Qualitative dataset is based on the used KPIs with ratio <br />

Which Project Category best describes your project? Build/improve applications or integrations to Ocean

What is the final product? <br />
A service data computing marketplace powered by Blockchain and inspection module powered by AI on top to be able to provide quality in training datasets and trustworthy algorithms.

Question on "value add" criteria: which one or more of the criteria will your project focus on? Why do you believe your team will do well on those criteria? <br />
Usage of Ocean and Viability - We believe we can improve and develop the C2D concept with our add-on module to be able to provide full awareness of data sensitivity and data quality. We are a pure tech team specialized mainly in system development and data science so we have the necessary expertise and knowledge to make this happen.

Part 3 - Proposal Details <br />

3.1 Details <br />
Details of the proposal: <br />
We would like to add a metadata feature where we inspect the datasets and detect the sensitive data by leveraging AI (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). The corresponding columns in the CSV file format that was detected as sensitive data will be ignored when we run the Compute Job by reading the results of the Sensitive Data Inspector Module in JSON when we configure the dataset path for the given algorithm. In this way, we will provide complete sensitive data security and also the “training data” concept. We will also assess the quality of the data by scanning through the data points to make sure that the main dimensions of data quality exist based on the relevant KPI that was applied in the AI Model.

3.2 If in Category "Build / improve applications or integration to Ocean": <br />
App will be live at: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/DatateraTech/DatateraBeta/1.0 <br />

Is the software open-source? We have commercial intentions for this software. <br />
Project software can be found at: https://github.com/DatateraTechnology	<br />

3.3 If the project includes software: <br />
Are there any mockups or designs to date? If yes, please share details / links. <br />

3.4 Project Deliverables - Roadmap <br />
Any prior work completed thus far? Details? <br />
The system architecture, result data structure and the tech stack details have been decided. 

What is the project roadmap? That is: what are key milestones, and the target date for each milestone. Please make sure that one milestone is about publishing your results, e.g. as a medium blog post. <br />
Grant Deliverables 1: Sensitive Text Data Inspector Function powered by AI
Output a result with a ratio indicating the columns that possibly contain sensitive data

Grant Deliverables 2: Qualitative Text Data Inspector Function powered by AI
Output a result with the ratio indicating the qualitativeness of the dataset that is based on the KPIs applied.

What are the team's future plans and intentions? Is there maintenance? Possible extensions to the work? <br />
Yes, we will maintain and develop further and fix bugs/errors since this module will be part of our Datatera solution.

Dataset format will be in CSV only from the beginning and we can definitely support more formats e.g. XML, Xls, etc., and even medical images.
We will probably add more KPI and metrics to be able to better detect the sensitive and qualitative datasets.
We will add possible extensions to this work to be able to provide more relevant AI insights on the metadata feature.

3.5 Additional Information <br />
We are fundraising at the moment for pre-seed.
